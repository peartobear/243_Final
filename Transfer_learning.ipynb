generation. The T5-small model is a smaller variant of the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) architecture, known for its versatility in various NLP tasks. By fine-tuning the model on a specific summarization dataset, the notebook showcases how to effectively generate concise and coherent summaries from longer text inputs. This approach demonstrates the power of transformer models and their adaptability for a range of NLP applications."],"metadata":{"id":"Vo38q0A3Zwz9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#importing google

The TV network and digital publisher has agreed to pay $135 million for the bankrupt blog network, according to a person familiar with the deal. Univision’s offer will encompass all seven of Gawker Media’s sites, including Gawker.com Ziff Davis and Univision were the only two bidders for Gawker, which filed for bankruptcy after Hulk Hogan and Peter Thiel won a $140 million judgment in a privacy case. Ziff Davis had originally offered $90 million for Gawker Media. Here's a statement from Gawker Media owner Nick Denton: \"Gawker Media Group has agreed this evening to sell our business and popular brands to Univision, one of America’s largest media companies that is rapidly assembling the leading digital media group for millennial and multicultural audiences. I am pleased that our employees are protected and will continue their work under new ownership — disentangled from the legal campaign against the company. We could not have picked an acquirer more devoted to vibrant journalism.\" Mark Patricof, the Houlihan Lokey banker who represented Gawker Media, confirmed the sale price. \"The outcome exceeded our expectations. Both parties put in an awful lot of work, and Ziff Davis deserves credit for their effort,\" Patricof said. \"But ultimately Univision prevailed, and both sides are happy with the outcome.\" The deal won’t be official for a bit. For starters, a U.S. bankruptcy court judge needs to sign off on the transaction. When it is final, the judgment funds will be set aside while Gawker appeals its court case; eventually the money will go to the side that wins. Whatever the result of the case, the auction is a disappointing conclusion for Denton, who founded the company in 2002. Last year, as rival media companies like Vice, BuzzFeed and Vox Media (which owns this site) were raising money at increasingly high valuations, Denton was arguing that his company was worth $250 million or more. Univision, which until recently was best known as a Spanish-language TV network, has been expanding its digital reach in recent years by acquiring satire site The Onion and The Root, a publication aimed at African-Americans. And earlier this year it picked up full ownership of Fusion, the network and digital publisher aimed at millennials, which it originally launched in conjunction with Disney.

British broadcaster Channel 4 News mounted a “sting operation” in which it secretly recorded Cambridge Analytica Chief Executive Alexander Nix saying he had met the then Republican presidential candidate “many times” and that his firm played a central role in the final months of the campaign.     “We did all the research. We did all the data. We did all the analytics. We did all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign and our data informed their strategy,” Nix told an undercover reporter during a meeting in a London hotel.   Brad Parscale, the 2016 Trump campaign’s main digital adviser who dealt regularly with Cambridge Analytica, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Parscale was recently named manager of Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign.  Nix was suspended by the board of directors of Cambridge Analytica on Tuesday, the company said shortly before the second part of the British news program’s expose on the company.  The London-based company’s statement said: “In the view of the board, Mr. Nix’s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.”  Nix also was recorded by Channel 4 saying that Cambridge Analytica did not have to reveal to U.S. investigators anything about the company’s foreign political campaign clients. If asked, he said he would respond: “We say ‘none of your business’.”   “I am absolutely convinced that they have no jurisdiction,” he said.  Nix was also dismissive about the testimony he gave to the U.S. House Intelligence Committee late last year [nL1N1OE1Q5].  “The Republicans ask three questions in five minutes. Done. The Democrats ask two hours of questions,” he said.  “They are politicians, they are not technical, they don’t understand how it works. They don’t understand that the candidate is never involved, he’s told what to do by the campaign team.”  The company named Julian Malins, a well-known British commercial barrister, to lead an independent investigation into Nix’s actions.

Before Carles Puigdemont addressed the crowd, many draped in Catalan flags, police estimated its size at 45,000. There were chants of “Puigdemont, President” from a generally good-natured throng, many of whom had traveled from Spain.  Some carried placards criticizing the European Union for not pressuring Madrid. One sign showed the face of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker with the question: “Democracy? Some defend it when it suits them. Shame on them.”  Puigdemont, who like many in the crowd wore yellow in support of jailed separatist leaders, addressed the crowd in Catalan before switching to French to direct a message to Juncker.  “Is there any place in the world that holds demonstrations like this to support criminals?” he said.  “So maybe we are not criminals. Maybe we are democrats.”  Spain’s Supreme Court on Tuesday withdrew an international arrest warrant for Puigdemont in order to bring his case back solely under Spanish jurisdiction, leaving him without an international legal stage to pursue his independence campaign.  Puigdemont and four of his cabinet members fled to Belgium when Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia and sacked his government after an Oct. 27 declaration of independence by his local government.  He is likely to be detained if he returns to Spain, pending investigation on charges of sedition, rebellion, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust.   Puigdemont said on Wednesday he would remain in Belgium for the time being.  “Brussels is a kind of a loudspeaker for us,” said Gloria Cot, a clerk from Barcelona at Thursday’s march who had just arrived by coach.  “It is a loudspeaker so that people can know that we really don’t have a 100 percent democracy in Spain and that Catalonia has always been subjected to problems with Spain.”  Juncker’s deputy Frans Timmermans said he welcomed the “very positive atmosphere” of the demonstration, which took place as campaigning gets under way for a Catalan election on Dec. 21.  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy hopes pro-independence parties will lose their majority in the Catalan parliament in the election and end the deadlock created by his government’s refusal to recognize a banned independence vote Puigdemont held in September.  Polls have separatists and unionist parties in a tie.  Timmermans said there was no change to Commission policy that the dispute with Catalan authorities remains an internal one in which the EU has no need to intervene because Spain’s democratic constitution is functioning in line with EU values.  He accused Puigdemont and his allies of undermining the rule of law by choosing to ignore a Spanish constitutional ban on secession rather than trying to change the constitution.  “If you do not agree with the law, you can organize yourselves to change the law or the constitution,” he said. “What is not permissible under the rule of law is to just ignore the law.”  Additional reporting and writing by Alastair Macdonald in Brussels and Sam Edwards in Barcelona; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Toby Chopra\n","['Tens of thousands of people have marched through Brussels in support of Catalan independence and the region’s ousted president, who has avoided arrest in Spain by taking refuge in Belgium.']\n","The sorority whose members loudly sang Kanye West's \"Gold Digger\" and included the n-word ... will NOT be punished ...

More than half of visits to shopping sites — 54 percent — will come from smartphones and tablets, surpassing desktop computers for the first time, according to Adobe Analytics’ annual suite of online holiday retail predictions. Customers are still more likely to actually complete a purchase on desktop after looking on mobile, but that’s changing. Mobile shopping will account for 34 percent of online purchase revenue, up from 30 percent last year. That means that mobile will have a bigger share of the predicted $107.4 billion in online holiday spending this year, up from $94.4 billion in 2016. While there’s still a disparity between mobile retail website visits and revenue, the move toward mobile shopping is inevitable. That trend will only grow as e-commerce eats up a larger portion of traditional brick-and-mortar retail. And retailers with better mobile websites and easier mobile payment integration stand to benefit the most. This trend also has implications for mobile advertising, which will get an increasing share of ad sales.

She was referring to “Sean’s Cloud” (2016), hung high up on the wall at Marian Goodman Gallery in Midtown. Dean made the work by photographing a cloud in California (where the Berlin-based British artist has been living for the past 18 months) and then painting around its image with blue chalkboard paint so meticulously that it produced a graphic, out-of-context effect. Painting around a cloud is about as futile as one can get, but for an artist who has chased after eclipses, green rays, and dead science fiction writers, this is nothing new.  Depending on how you count, there are anywhere between one and six bodies of work on display in this sprawling solo show. The main gallery is filled with clouds, shown as lithographs, chalk drawings on antique slate blackboards, painted-over postcards, and the aforementioned painted photographs. In the back is a room full of photographs of Cy Twombly’s Italian home, made on the very last available batch of Cibachrome photographic paper. There are also three films, each very different from the others: “Portraits” (2016) shows David Hockney smoking five highly entertaining cigarettes in his studio; “Buon Fresco” (2014) takes an intimate look at Giotto’s frescos at the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi; and, screening in the third-floor project space, “Event for a Stage” (2015) is a spectacular film made as a result of Dean’s first foray into performance.  Thematically, we could say there are two bodies of work here: one about clouds and the other about artists, namely Twombly, Giotto, Hockney, and Dean herself. But there is a single driving force behind all the work, the same focused, loving, stubborn, and ultimately doomed ambition that propels Dean’s entire oeuvre: the impossible task of capturing what cannot be caught, of saving what is already lost. In that regard, making drawings in chalk without fixative is the same as painting around a cloud is the same as following a master’s hand centuries after his death. We, the viewers, know we’re looking at the traces of something powerful that has passed. Although prolific in many other areas, the core of Dean’s work is film, and the most important of the films in this show is “Event for a Stage,” which disappointingly comes down a month before everything else. If you’re interested in narrative and the places where it breaks down; or in the roles of the artist as author, interpreter, and performer; or in the way theater, art, and film work their magic, you should see this piece. It opens on a hangar-like hall filling up with spectators. We see them finding their seats around the circular stage area and chattering. They seem unaware of the cameras rolling and of actor Stephen Dillane (The Hours, Game of Thrones), who is walking along the edge of the stage — marked by nothing more than a chalk circle on the black floor — in a confident, almost angry stride. He appears like a caged animal, or, as his character will later describe himself, “like an actor in his element, like a beast in its lair.” Dillane shares the stage with two 16 mm cameras, and as they follow him the audience’s heads in the background run together, like film sprocket holes racing alongside the action in the frames.  When I was asked if I wanted to come and play the role of an actor on stage I said no. I said, “Will there be a text?” She said: “I don’t know.” I said “That’s quite a risk. How long would I be on stage?” “About forty minutes, I think.” “That’s quite a long time to be on stage alone.” She said “Is it?”  —The Actor, “Event for a Stage” “Event for a Stage” was commissioned by the 19th Biennale of Sydney (in 2014) and Carriageworks, a large Australian contemporary arts center. Dean is not a performance artist, but she has made performance her topic on more than one occasion, most notably in her films about Merce Cunningham and his dance company. Dean was invited (read: convinced) to create her first live performance work by the biennale’s artistic director, Juliana Engberg, and in turn she recruited Stephen Dillane, whose presence onstage (and off, if you believe the script) shifts from heartbreaking to terrifying with storm-like abruptness.  What might be harder to discern on first viewing is that we’re not watching a film of a single live performance, but rather a hybrid of four of them, made seamless thanks to masterful performing by Dillane and editing by Dean. The only giveaway that this Franken-film is comprised of the parts of four separate performances is that Dillane’s hair and makeup change in each one. The styles range from the actor’s long, natural, flowing hair and no makeup to white period wigs and drawn-on wrinkles. But the film moves along so smoothly that it takes a while to notice even these striking gaps in continuity. In 2008, a year before her subject’s death, Dean made a film titled “Merce Cunningham performs STILLNESS (in three movements) to John Cage’s composition 4’33” with Trevor Carlson, New York City, 28 April 2007 (six performances; six films),” which I have written about in the past. The choreography entailed Cunningham sitting as still as possible for the duration of his dead lover’s most famous work. He performed the piece multiple times for the camera, and the idea was to use the best take for the final work. Dean, however, ended up using all the takes and projecting them simultaneously, because she realized that rather than witnessing the same thing happen three times, she was seeing different phenomena occur one after the other. I think the lesson she learned shooting Cunningham led her to the structure of “Event for a Stage,”which was explicitly planned as four performances woven into one film.  There is an invisible thing around this stage, separating me from you: you, being the audience. It is a film of protection; it protects me, and the action on stage, and it also protects you. Above all, it protects the magic of suspended disbelief that is theatre. Without the invisible film that contains everything on the stage there would be no context for my actions, no discourse, no history. —The Actor, “Event for a Stage” The script performed by Dillane is comprised of four texts, of which two have (more or less) confirmed authors: a monologue from Shakespeare’s The Tempest and Heinrich von Kleist’s wonderful essay “On the Marionette Theatre.” The other two are more complicated: one is a seemingly autobiographical piece by Dillane about his youth and the decline of his parents; the other, which Dean hands to the actor page by page from her seat in the audience, is a meta, perhaps meta-fictional account of the relationship between the artist and her performer, filled with remembered bits of conversations and musings about the symbolic mechanics of theater and filmmaking. This last one is the trickiest because, while it sounds like Dean’s writing, it’s spoken from the perspective of Dillane. All Dean was willing to say of this thickened plot was: “Don’t be beguiled into thinking just because it’s in the script in my hand that I wrote it and just because Stephen recites those words outside the circle that he wrote them.”  “Have you ever had stage fright?” Dillane reads from a page. He looks up, glaring, and answers: “No.” Throughout the film, stage fright and the prospect of “drying up” (on stage and as an artist) are mentioned again and again, like invocations of the evil eye, meant to prevent it from visiting. Dillane’s script goes on at length about what a bad idea it is to strand an actor alone on a stage for over 40 minutes, about how Dean’s text, the only thing he has to rely on, is “not a great work.” But it is a great work, as is the film to which it belongs, and both Dean and Dillane are virtuosic on either side of the camera. As the film progresses and we become aware that it’s cut from four different performances, it also becomes clear that every whisper and roar, every turn, every word has been perfectly choreographed and repeated exactly the same way each time, making it possible to slip seamlessly from one to the other, sometimes cutting between performances mid-word. In “Event for a Stage,” an artist is looking back at herself through the prism of a performer. The performer, in turn, reflects on his trajectory (as a son, an actor), while reminding us all along that this is also a film about itself: Dillane constantly interrupts himself to call out the reel changes on the cameras. But the topic that recurs the most is those blurred heads we saw in the beginning: us, the audience, whose faith in the artwork exists in the vertiginous borderland of what Dean terms “the membrane or the connective tissue” between an artist and her public. In fact, “membrane” and “connective tissue” should not have an “or” between them: they are not analogous but opposites. A membrane separates, while connective tissue binds.

The volume of imports in January through April was 1,652,982 terajoules (TJ) or 47 billion cubic metres (cbm), according to trade statistics office BAFA.  German importers paid 8.8 billion euros ($10 billion) for gas during the period, compared with 8.1 billion a year earlier, mirroring higher oil prices.  Gas, power and carbon traders watch gas imports as possible imbalances in supply and demand can change prices and traded volumes in all three markets.  There is currently abundant supply in the summer season.  German gas stocks were at 77.54% of available storage capacity on Wedenesday, the European gas infrastructure group GIE’s website showed. That compared with 42.99% a year earlier.  Germany mainly imports gas from Russia, Norway, the Netherlands, Britain and Denmark via pipelines.  Europe’s imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are also increasing.  The average BAFA-quoted price for pipeline gas on the German border in April was 4,574.99 euros per TJ, equivalent to 1.65 euro cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), 6.9% below the price a year earlier.  $1 = 0.8826 euros Reporting by Vera Eckert; Editing by Mark Potter\n","['Germany imported more gas in the first four months of this year than it did in the same period a year earlier.']\n","Britain mourned lawmaker Jo Cox on Friday after a man wielding a gun and knife killed the 41-year-old in an attack that has thrown a June 23 referendum on European Union membership into limbo. Cox, a supporter of Britain staying in the EU, was shot and stabbed after a meeting with residents in her own constituency near Leeds in northern England by a man who witnesses said had shouted \"Britain first\". She was pronounced dead just over 48 minutes later by a doctor working with a paramedic crew trying to save her life. A 52-year-old man named by media as Thomas Mair was arrested by officers nearby and weapons including a firearm were recovered. The killing prompted campaigning to be suspended in the EU referendum, the tone of which has become increasingly angry and bitter and included personal recriminations as well as furious debate of issues such as immigration and the economy. It was not immediately clear when campaigning for the referendum would resume. A spokesman for the \"Vote Leave\" campaign said they would clarify plans later in the day. Britain mourned lawmaker Jo Cox on Friday after a man wielding a gun and knife killed the 41-year-old in an attack that has thrown a June 23 referendum on European Union membership into limbo.

It was not immediately clear when campaigning for the referendum would resume. A spokesman for the \"Vote Leave\" campaign said they would clarify plans later in the day. The implied probability of a vote for Britain to remain in the EU rose to 67 percent, up from 65 percent on Thursday, according to Betfair odds. Though the motives of the killer were not immediately clear, some suggested sympathy for Cox could boost the Remain campaign which opinion polls indicate had fallen behind Leave. Police said they were not in a position to discuss the motive of the attack. \"Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it every day of her life with an energy and a zest for life that would exhaust most people,\" Cox's husband, Brendan, said. Related: Obama's 'Town Hall' Meeting with British Youth Covered Gender Rights, Islamophobia, and Leadership \"She would have wanted two things above all else to happen now, one that our precious children are bathed in love and two, that we all unite to fight against the hatred that killed her.\" A US civil rights group the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), based in Alabama, said on its website that it had obtained records showing a Thomas Mair had links with the neo-Nazi organization National Alliance (NA) dating back to 1999. The SPLC posted images showing what it said were purchase orders for books bought by Mair, whose address is given as Batley, from the NA's publishing arm National Vanguard Books in May of that year. The orders included a manual on how to build a pistol, it said. Britain's Union flag was flying at half-mast over the Houses of Parliament, Queen Elizabeth's London residence Buckingham Palace and Downing Street, where Prime Minister David Cameron has his official residence. In Birstall hundreds of people attended a vigil at a local church. Queen Elizabeth was due to write a private letter of condolence to Cox's husband. Some people, many weeping, laid flowers outside the Houses of Parliament. Beside a picture of Cox smiling, dozens of white candles lay beside bunches of flowers and a message board upon which people had written their condolences. \"You can't kill democracy,\" read one message on Parliament Square. Another said: \"We will unite against hatred.\" Others put flowers on the houseboat on the River Thames where Cox had lived with her husband and two young children aged three and five. Beside flowers at the murder scene in Birstall, a message read: \"Fascists feed on fear.\" British politicians paid tribute to Cox and expressed shock at the killing, as did leaders across Europe and the world. Cameron said the killing of Cox, who had worked on US President Barack Obama's 2008 election campaign, was a tragedy. Related: 'A Historic Turning Point?' EU Leaders Stay Up All Night Failing to Reach a Deal on Britain \"We have lost a great star,\" said Cameron, who called the referendum. \"She was a great campaigning MP with huge compassion, with a big heart. It is dreadful, dreadful news.\" Hillary Clinton said she was horrified. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the attack \"terrible\" but added that she didn't want to link it to the EU referendum. Media reports, citing witnesses, said the attacker had shouted out \"Britain first,\" the name of a right-wing nationalist group that describes itself on its website as \"a patriotic political party and street defense organization\". The deputy leader of the group, Jayda Fransen, distanced it from the attack, which she described as \"absolutely disgusting\". West Yorkshire's elected Police and Crime Commissioner said \"our information is that this is a localized incident, albeit one that has a much wider impact\". Family members, including his brother, said that Mair had not expressed strong political views, the Guardian newspaper reported. \"He has a history of mental illness but he has had help,\" the Guardian quoted his brother, Scott Mair, as saying. \"My brother is not violent and is not all that political. I don't even know who he votes for.\" Neighbors described a man who had lived in the same house for at least 40 years and helped locals weed their flowerbeds and inquired after their pets. \"I'm totally devastated — I didn't want to believe it. He's been very helpful to me. Anything I asked him to do he did very willingly and sometimes without my needing to ask,\" said next-door neighbor Diana Peters, 65.

Gun ownership is highly restricted in Britain, and attacks of any nature on public figures are rare. The last British lawmaker to have been killed in an attack was Ian Gow, who died after a bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) exploded under his car at his home in southern England in 1990. Colleagues expressed shock and disbelief at the death of Cox, a Cambridge University graduate who spent a decade working for aid agency Oxfam and promoted women's issues. \"We've lost a wonderful woman, we've lost a wonderful member of parliament, but our democracy will go on,\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a televised statement. \"As we mourn her memory, we'll work in her memory to achieve that better world she spent her life trying to achieve.\"\n","['\"Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it every day of her life with an energy and a zest for life that would never be forgotten.\"']\n","The news, but shorter.

Union was trying to thwart Brexit.  Bannon, a former chairman of the right-wing Breitbart.com website and an architect of Trump’s 2016 election win, has set up a movement to elect right-wing nationalist and populist members in European Parliament elections next May.  The EU’s elites, he said, did not want Brexit.  “You see what’s happened. They have no intention of letting you guys leave - none. Zero,” Bannon said at the Oxford Union debating society, though he gave no evidence other than saying the EU had made the divorce negotiation difficult.  “They’ve made it as hard as possible, they will continue to make it as hard as possible,” Bannon said.  The United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019. In the June 23, 2016 EU referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 52 percent, backed Brexit while 16.1 million, or 48 percent, backed staying in the bloc.  EU leaders have repeatedly said they are saddened by the UK’s decision to leave and that they will respect the decision.   British Prime Minister Theresa May struck a divorce deal with the EU this week, though opponents in her divided party are trying to topple her because they think the deal would keep the UK too close to the EU after Brexit.  Bannon faced several hundred protesters in Oxford who accused him of being a racist. Police officers eventually escorted the 64-year-old into the Oxford University society’s historic debating chamber through a back entrance.

But Puerto Rico’s recovery from last year’s Hurricane Maria has been a “mixed bag,” Rossello told Reuters on Thursday, acknowledging that the bankrupt U.S. territory, while improving, is far from out of the woods.  Puerto Rico has received only a small fraction of the federal funding it needs to get back on its feet, Rossello said in a 75-minute interview, and getting access to the rest could take more than a decade.  His administration estimates that fixing Puerto Rico fully will require $139 billion, but the federal government has earmarked only about $60 billion to $65 billion for the recovery, he said. Of that, only about $3 billion to $4 billion has actually flowed into the island’s coffers. Obtaining the remainder could take 10 to 11 years, he said, adding that his team is lobbying the U.S. Congress for more money.   Compounding the problem is Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy in U.S. federal court, where it is trying to restructure $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. There are also ongoing spending disputes between the government and a federally appointed fiscal oversight board.   In the year since Hurricane Maria, Rossello has at times been diplomatic regarding the federal government’s response, while at other times – especially lately - adopting a more critical take. He has also been criticized for sticking with an estimated death toll of 64 early-on, when strong evidence suggested it could be higher. A government-commissioned study by researchers at George Washington University eventually pegged the toll at around 3,000.  When asked whether his administration’s messaging strategies have been tied to an effort to maintain good relations with President Donald Trump, Rossello said a “critical part” of the island’s recovery “is making sure the federal government responds to our petitions.”   “So yes, I have opted for a path that involves dialogue, that involves collaboration,” Rossello said, adding that he has not been afraid to be critical.   If Trump does not sign the island’s request to extend the federal government’s 100 percent coverage of repair costs, “I’ll be the first one to fight it,” Rossello said, “and I’ll be the first to point out that action, or lack of action, is one of the main obstacles to our recovery.”   Rossello said Puerto Rico still has as many as 60,000 homes with temporary tarp roofs. It also has hundreds of thousands of informally constructed homes with many owners lacking title to their property.   Rebuilding will require the current ranks of about 45,000 construction workers to grow to 130,000, according to Rossello, who recently signed an executive order increasing the minimum hourly construction wage to $15 despite opposition from the oversight board and the private sector.  The island’s government is still considering initiatives that could make the island’s troubled electricity grid more resilient, Rossello said. Ultimately, the island hopes to generate 40 percent of its electricity from renewables and steer away from fossil fuels. The shift would require a new regulatory policy, approval by the bondholders, and, potentially,  investment from outside companies or organizations.  “We have received 10 to 12 unsolicited proposals for generation,” he said, while acknowledging the government has yet to find a private operator for the power utility’s transmission and distribution operations.   But changes at the electric agency known as PREPA, which Rossello called one of the most troubled organizations in modern history, will be gradual. The governor said he is working with a search firm to identify outside board members for the utility, after nearly the entire board quit in an uproar over appointment of a new CEO.     Limited electricity was a major problem for the island’s small business sector, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York report on Thursday. A survey of more than 400 businesses with fewer than 500 employees found 77 percent suffered losses as a result of hurricanes Irma and Maria.   Meanwhile, Rossello is trying not only to restore tourism, but to expand it in such a way that it incorporates hundreds of square miles of seaside and mountain communities that are largely unvisited. Puerto Rico’s tourism is small compared with other Caribbean locales and tends to be centered in San Juan.  The island’s visitor lodgings hit a 2017 high of 204,025 in July, but fell to just under 30,000 in October following the hurricanes, according to Puerto Rico Tourism Company data.  Convincing tourists to leave the capital, though, will require easier travel. “Puerto Rico should be a multi-port destination,” he said, discussing plans to beef up airport capacity in the south and west of the island.   He emphasized the possibility of capitalizing on Puerto Rico’s near-constant spate of community festivals. “We have flower festivals, orange festivals, plantain festivals, coffee festivals, music festivals.”  Rossello pointed to so-called chinchorreos as a possible draw, events in which Puerto Rican foodies move from one inexpensive eatery to the next.   “A bar crawl for food - that’s the best way to put it,” the governor said, “and the island is small, so you start in one place and you’re on a beachfront, and 15 minutes later you’re in the mountains.”  Reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault and Nick Brown in New York, Karen Pierog in Chicago and Luis Valentin Ortiz in San Juan; Editing by Daniel Bases and Matthew Lewis</div>"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["<div style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Generated summary: the governor flew to new york this week on a mission persuade potential tourists that hurricane-ravaged island was ready for their return. but Puerto Rico’s recovery from last year’s hurricane Maria has been “mixed bag”.</div>"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\n","Article:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["<div style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Reuters) - South Africa’s Northam Platinum said on Wednesday mining operations at the Kukama shaft at its Eland mine would recommence in the 2020 financial year after the conclusion of a feasibility study on the project.  Northam bought a 100% interest in Eland from Glencore’s South African unit in February 2017 for 175 million rand ($12.2 million). The mine had been placed on care and maintenance in 2015 due to a price fall and difficult operating conditions.  Northam continued to manage the Eland mine, situated in North West province, on care and maintenance while undertaking the feasibility study for the Kukama shaft.  The study found that the life of the mine was in excess of 30 years and estimated positive free cash flow to be generated from year four onwards. It also forecast investment returns “comfortably in excess of Northam’s current weighted average cost of capital”, the miner said in a statement.  Annual production at Kukama is forecast to reach 100,000 ounces of the four elements making up the platinum group metals — platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold - by 2025, with steady state production of 150,000 ounces per year from 2029.  “The project further diversifies the group’s operations and production capacity and does so efficiently by utilising an extensive existing capital footprint,” Northam chief executive Paul Dunne said.  Work done to the shaft in preparation for its recommissioning includes refurbishing underground fixed and mobile equipment, as well as certain sections of the concentrator. Processing of the tailings storage facility at the Eland mine has also commenced, the miner said.  Developmental capital expenditure is estimated at 2.2 billion rand over five years, in nominal terms, which includes a provision for working capital requirements during the development phase, Northam added.  The project will be fully funded from Northam’s resources.

A poll by Marist showed Trump coming in fourth among voters under 30, trailing even Independent candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein. These numbers are bad for Trump, but they could be even worse for Republicans in the long term. For the first time since the '50s, Democrats are poised to win double-digit victories among young voters for the third presidential election in a row. Related: Yet another Republican is publicly disowning Donald Trump Whatever Donald Trump's political magic is, it does not seem to be working as well on the young. A new poll shows Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton battering her Republican foe among younger voters by a margin of 56 percent to 20 percent.

Related: Yet another Republican is publicly disowning Donald Trump Many comparisons have been made between the mogul and right-wing populists such as France's Marine Le Pen and the crew leading Germany's nationalist AfD Party, but Trump's lousy numbers among youngsters set him apart from his counterparts across the Atlantic. Le Pen's National Front Party recently won the largest share of 18-30s in last year's round of elections, while the AfD enjoys the second-youngest party membership in Germany. As Fusion reported earlier this year, there is nothing inherently liberal about younger voting blocs, and any success of Trump's message in the US would suggest the country is headed in a similar direction to its European allies. But even with surveys indicating \"soft\" racism among millennials, America's youth appears to be embracing the social democratic tones of Clinton's onetime challenger for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders, rather than Trump's nationalism — at least for now.

Just think about everything that changed during his presidency. He signed into law a comprehensive national health insurance bill, a goal that had eluded progressive presidents for a century. He got surprisingly tough reforms to Wall Street passed as well, not to mention a stimulus package that both blunted the recession and transformed education and energy policy. He's put in place the toughest climate rules in American history and signed a major international climate accord. He opened the US to Cuba for the first time in more than half a century, and reached a peaceful settlement to the nuclear standoff with Iran. He opened the military to LGBTQ Americans and appointed Supreme Court justices who made same-sex marriage the law of the land. And now, with the election of Donald Trump and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress, almost all of that legacy is imperiled. Trump has promised to repeal Obamacare, to dismantle the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, to reverse the deal with Iran, and to scrap all climate regulations. Much of that he could do with executive power alone. The rest could be done with a cooperative Congress, in some cases even without a filibuster-proof majority. We don’t know yet how much Trump, Paul Ryan, and Mitch McConnell will actually be able to do. But if they do what they’ve promised, Obama’s ultimate legacy will be greatly diminished. Maybe his policies would be brought back by future presidents — but maybe they’ll be gone forever. Maybe, like Ulysses S. Grant, he will go down as a president who enacted a huge number of crucial, socially progressive policies that were abandoned as soon as he left office. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 touched almost every aspect of American health care policy. They created massive new subsidies for insurance for people not poor enough to be covered by Medicaid. They greatly expanded Medicaid too. They also set new protections for women, people with preexisting conditions, and people 26 and younger to expand their access to health care. But the most important thing those laws did, the thing that cemented Obama’s legacy as an expander of the American welfare state in the tradition of LBJ or FDR, was establish that it was the responsibility of the US government to provide its citizens with health care. As Brian Steensland, a sociologist who studies American social policy at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, told me back in 2015, \"The main thing it does, I think, is establish the expectation in the public’s mind that access to basic health care is a right. It’s going to be hard to go back to a time when access to health insurance, and the subsidies to help pay for it, wasn’t near universal.\" We’re about to find out how hard. On paper, it’s clearly possible for Trump and his allies in Congress to dismantle some or all of Obamacare. Some things Trump can unilaterally change by executive fiat — like redefining “preventive health care for women” to not include birth control. Other things he can do through the budget reconciliation process, like ending Obamacare's insurance subsidies, Medicaid expansion, taxes, and individual mandate. Budget reconciliation bills are filibuster-proof, so assuming more moderate-leaning Republican senators like Susan Collins don’t defect, Trump and the Republican Congress could pass all of that. Still more things, like the extension of health insurance to 26-year-olds, can’t go through budget reconciliation and would face a Democratic filibuster — unless Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ends the filibuster altogether, which is very possible given that it was ended for most nominations just three years ago. The question is: Will they actually follow through, and if so, what will they replace Obamacare with? On the first point, it’s telling that McConnell has refused to commit to using budget reconciliation to repeal Obamacare. That opens the door to letting Democrats filibuster repeal efforts. Given the enormous political pain that could await Republicans should they suddenly deny 22 million people health care, it’s easy to imagine savvy operators like McConnell eyeing repeal warily, and looking for ways to act like they want to repeal the law while letting Democrats prevent them from actually doing so. It’s also worth keeping in mind that while Trump has been consistently anti-Obamacare this election, he has in the past expressed very different views on government-subsidized health care programs, and it’s hard to know how firmly he’ll stick to his campaign pledges. One possibility is that McConnell and Trump insist on including a replacement package in any repeal — and then the question becomes what precisely is in that package. Trump has promised to replace it with “something terrific” with “much better healthcare”: I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. We will have MUCH less expensive and MUCH better healthcare. With Hillary, costs will triple! If that something is his stated replacement plan, which offers tax deductions for health insurance, the result will be a massive increase in the uninsured population. His stated approach effectively replaces the insurance subsidies and support of Obamacare with nothing at all. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Avik Roy, a conservative health policy expert who has advised Rick Perry and Mitt Romney, has offered a right-leaning reform plan that repeals the Medicaid expansion, tax hikes, and individual mandate from Obamacare, but keeps insurance exchanges and preserves progressive, sliding-scale insurance subsidies for poor and middle-class Americans. Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT), the latter of whom chairs the Senate Finance Committee, have offered a plan very similar to this. Paul Ryan's latest plan would preserve a refundable health care tax credit, albeit one that does not increase in size for poorer Americans. These are not, to be very clear, Democratic proposals. They loosen insurance regulation on the exchanges considerably. Roy would abolish Medicaid for beneficiaries not needing long-term care, instead offering tax subsidies on the exchanges, while Burr and Hatch would block-grant Medicaid. These are not proposals that President Obama would have signed into law. But Roy asserts that his plan would increase health coverage by 9 million relative to Obamacare. Hatch and Burr would decrease it by 3 million, Ryan by 2 million. I’m not sure I’m that optimistic about the plans’ effects. But even if they “only” reduce insurance by 5 million, that’s far, far better than outright repealing Obamacare and leaving 22 million people without insurance. If the Roy plan, or the Hatch/Burr plan, becomes law, Obama’s health care legacy will survive in at least some form. Millions of people will continue to be insured who would not have been had he not pushed Obamacare through in 2010. But if Trump passes his current reform plan, then Obama’s greatest accomplishment, his pledge that the federal government will ensure near-universal coverage, will be destroyed. The thing about the welfare state is that it creates beneficiaries. If the new Republican majority chooses not to explode the uninsured population, it will be because they consider denying health care to 22 million people — and even more than that, should Medicaid be block-granted and gutted — to be a political catastrophe. At least some of those 22 million people vote, and they may be more inclined to turn out if their livelihood is under threat. Not all elements of domestic policy are like this. Banking regulation, for instance, intensely affects the people who don’t like it — bankers — while having diffuse benefits across the citizenry. The number of Americans who voted against Donald Trump because they wanted to save Obamacare is significant. The number who voted against him to save Dodd-Frank is negligible. And so it’s reasonable to expect that Dodd-Frank will be gutted. Trump has not offered many specifics on this, but Paul Ryan has indicated he would at the very least want to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Financial Stability Oversight Council — the latter being a new oversight board created to ensure major financial institutions don't imperil the economy, and to force their breakup if they do. You could do both of those through a combination of budget and executive policy — or through regular legislation. Trump could just not convene or use the FSOC. He and Congress could end its independent funding and subject it to a hostile appropriations process. And House Republicans also want to pass legislation subjecting all regulations to affirmative congressional rules, making it harder for future presidents to reverse Trump’s policies here. The budget-based path won’t face a filibuster. But even if some parts of this agenda are filibusterable, it’s not inconceivable that finance-friendly Democrats like Mark Warner could go along with some of it and get it to 60 votes. Same goes for the environment. Obama’s climate policies are meant to benefit people far in the future, limiting the constituency that can fight rollback today. As Vox’s Brad Plumer explains, Trump can do an awful lot through executive action alone, by declining to defend Obama’s Clean Power Plan in court, or declining to enforce it, or ordering the Environmental Protection Agency to come up with new, weaker rules. This would all prompt a vociferous backlash from environmental groups in court, just as the Bush administration’s foot-dragging on global warming did, but it would change policy for years before the legal cases worked their way through. The bigger question is whether Congress passes legislation stripping the EPA of the right to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. This would face a Senate filibuster, but some Democrats, like Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, might support it, and McConnell might junk the filibuster altogether. One place where Obama's legacy could last a bit longer is LGBTQ rights. Trump has shown no interest in reinstituting a ban on LGBTQ service in the military (a return of the ban on trans soldiers appears likelier), and the Supreme Court is loath to overturn recent precedents, which could help ensure that same-sex marriage remains the law of the land. But the fact remains that Obama's two Supreme Court appointments both replaced fellow liberals. He changed the courts in a serious way lower down, but the Supreme Court is split in roughly the same way it was before he took office, and Trump's replacement for Antonin Scalia will ensure it stays that way. Federal anti-discrimination policy will take a hit, but most of the Obama administration’s gains in this area are likely to be preserved. On foreign issues, Obama's record is perhaps the most successful of any Democratic president since Truman. He has reestablished productive diplomacy as the central task of a progressive foreign policy, and as a viable alternative approach to dealing with countries the GOP foreign policy establishment would rather bomb. He rebuilt America’s reputation in the world and among its allies after the damage of the Bush years. Residents of countries like France and Germany came to trust us again. He showed his commitment to the NATO alliance by pushing back on Russian expansion in Eastern Europe. He made historic deals with Iran and Cuba that fundamentally altered America’s relationships with them. He tried extremely hard not to alienate Muslim communities abroad, including doing things that brought him tremendous flak like not using the term “radical Islam.” While not going far enough for some hawks’ taste, he forcefully condemned the Assad regime in Syria and armed rebels resisting it. Trump promises to reverse almost all of this. He has pledged to tear up the Iran deal and make a new one with Cuba. He is enthusiastically pro-Russia and sympathetic to Assad’s aims. He is widely loathed by residents of most other developed countries, and will augur a return to the Bush-era anti-American sentiment that pervaded European Union countries. And he has promised to revive torture and vicious, uncompromising, civilian-indifferent warfare in the fight against Islamist terror groups. This will help radical Islamist groups’ recruiting and further damage America’s international reputation, undoing the progress Obama made by repudiating the Bush administration’s wars and torture regime. There might be some things that remain. Maybe Trump blinks on Iran; he’ll be under tremendous pressure from EU countries to not renege on the deal. He’s signaled that he doesn’t want to cut off relations with Cuba entirely, which would preserve Obama’s historic opening there as part of his legacy. But overall, we should expect a near-180 reversal from Obama to Trump here, and for much of Obama’s work to undo the legacy of the Bush administration to itself be undone. And beyond all of that, Trump’s own policies — his Muslim ban, his border wall, his call for nationwide stop and frisk — represent a remarkable and large-scale repudiation of Obama’s vision for America, one that emphasized interreligious and interethnic tolerance, that sought to bring in Muslims at home and abroad as partners, that sought to protect millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation, and that used the Department of Justice to fight police departments that brutalized black communities. Obama did not have a universally pro-immigrant record, marred as his first years were by historic deportation rates. But his second term featured a dedicated push for immigration reform, resulting in a Senate-passed bill and extensive executive actions that defended millions of undocumented immigrants from removal. Trump, by contrast, promises the most hostile administration immigrants will face since Calvin Coolidge. Obama’s DOJ has taken police violence against unarmed black men extremely seriously, investigating and issuing incredibly damning reports in the aftermath of the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. The DOJ has a significant amount of power in forcing reforms in local departments, and Obama was committed to using it. It’s hard to imagine Trump, the man who demanded the deaths of the Central Park Five and wants racially biased policing methods taken national, doing much of anything to crack down on these departments. It’s definitely hard to imagine Rudy Giuliani, who might become attorney general and who oversaw some fairly shocking police abuses as mayor of New York, caring much. Obama began his presidency having to defend himself from racist attacks alleging he was a Muslim, and perhaps unsurprisingly he has continued George W. Bush’s strong rhetorical denunciations of Islamophobia. When 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested for bringing a homemade clock to school, Obama invited him to the White House. He told a Gold Star mother who demanded he denounce radical Islam, “[w]hat I have been careful about when I describe these issues is to make sure that we do not lump these murderers into the billion Muslims that exist around the world, including in this country, who are peaceful, who are responsible, who, in this country, are fellow troops and police officers and fire fighters and teachers and neighbors and friends.” He continued: “If you had an organization that was going around killing and blowing people up and said, 'We're on the vanguard of Christianity.' As a Christian, I'm not going to let them claim my religion and say, 'you're killing for Christ.' I would say, that's ridiculous.” Trump, by contrast, wants to as a matter of national policy lump in the billion peaceful Muslims with radical terrorists, by enforcing a ban on Muslims entering the country. This is as clear a repudiation of Obama’s entire worldview, built on interracial and interethnic tolerance, as you can imagine in a successor.</div>"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["<div style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Generated summary: he signed into law a health insurance bill that had eluded progressive presidents for century. got tough reforms to wall street, not mention stimulus package blunted the government.</div>"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\n","Article:\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["<div style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Early on in The Lost City of Z, our hero, Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam), is described with thinly veiled disdain by one upper-crusty older fellow to another as having been “rather unfortunate in his choice of ancestors.” Fawcett’s well-born father pissed away the family fortune; so, as a young man and the only undecorated officer in his military regiment, Percy aims to regain his family’s honor. That aim ultimately drives him straight into the jungle. He’s assigned to join a major expedition sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society — a dangerous journey to map Bolivia and establish its borders. The mission will take him away from his beloved wife and young son for several years. Maybe forever. But Fawcett has just toasted with a fellow soldier “to death, the best sauce for life,” and while the assignment is certainly a good opportunity to redeem his family’s reputation, the glint in his eye betrays the truth: Fawcett craves an adventure, for reasons even he can’t articulate. And in telling his story, The Lost City of Z becomes a cinematic song for those who love deeply and live thoroughly but are never quite satisfied. Fawcett’s nameless, shapeless desire slowly gathers mass over the course of The Lost City of Z, acquiring a barely discernible outline — though what Fawcett is truly after is still a mystery by the end. Based on David Grann’s 2010 book about Fawcett (which itself grew out of his 2005 New Yorker article on the explorer), it feels like a movie from an earlier era. That’s not surprising, given that it’s written and directed by James Gray (The Immigrant), who normally trains his classical sensibility on small, intimate stories. This is a different sort of movie: a stately, elegant epic paced like an elegy. The Lost City of Z follows a hero who feels earthbound by his ancestors but longs for something greater, some experience that defies definition, to discover something beyond what his own civilization has managed to produce. He craves distinction. But even more, he craves the experience of transcendence: to move beyond his world and see it as a bigger place, without the strictures placed on him by the culture and religion he was raised in. The world, he suspects, is much bigger than anything we can see. And brushes with death only make life more piercingly sweet. Fawcett’s first trip to “Amazonia,” as it’s called, yields some revelations. The jungle is verdant, and life-threatening. A traveler might stumble on a snake or on an opera performance staged by the rubber company that’s harvesting in the region. And the “savages,” who are considered subhuman by the explorers back at the Royal Geographical Society, may actually be far more advanced than the British, with whole civilizations created and lost before white people ever managed to set foot in the jungle. Those civilizations include a city that’s been nicknamed Z by those who whisper about its riches, both those native to the jungle and adventurers who hear the story. Fawcett doesn’t quite manage to find the city — only evidence that it exists. But he returns to England, along with his hardy and sober assistant Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson), full of memories of the place and the firm conviction that he must go back to Amazonia. He convinces the society that his return must happen for the good of science and humanity. At one of its meetings, he thunders from the podium that it’s the self-styled “civilized” men who have it all wrong: The men in the jungle are not “savages” but intelligent and, in his view, very likely equal to the white man. For this absurdity, he takes a verbal drubbing from the heckling audience, but also gains their approval to embark on another trip, with Costin in tow. Also along for the adventure is James Murray (Angus Macfadyen), whose claim to fame is that he previously traveled with the great Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton. But the jungle is not the Antarctic, and Murray is barely up to the task. The story spins on from there, with Fawcett pulling away from the exploration at intervals to spend time with his family and to serve in the war, all the while harboring an almost erotic desire to be back in that sweaty, mosquito-filled jungle. He wants to hunt for Z, but as Costin eventually explains to him, Fawcett is looking for something more, something to complete him. The great accomplishment of The Lost City of Z is how its narrative pace slows, almost imperceptibly, as it glides smoothly from history-rooted concreteness — Fawcett, his associates, and the society are all real — and toward a more abstracted way of telling the story. By the end, it’s as if we’ve passed into myth without noticing or really understanding how it happened. Under Gray’s direction, the actors (particularly Hunnam) deliver their lines with deliberation and enunciation, almost as if they’re being pulled off the pages of a book in real time. And as Fawcett’s life continues and the years pass, the weight of his experiences in the jungle seems to weigh on him, and on us. The memories and images are always settled on his shoulders, and ours. That careful pacing makes for a movie that feels more like a bittersweet lament, a wish that finite man could know the world more fully in the time he’s allotted. Percy Fawcett is all of us, in the end — knowing we can only find ourselves in losing ourselves to a person or an idea much bigger than us.

The news puts an end to months of speculation around the heavily-contested auction which drew interest from a broad spectrum of buyout firms that are flush with cash to invest.   WPP had shortlisted a series of U.S. buyout funds to submit binding bids for a majority stake in Kantar including Apollo and Platinum, Reuters reported in May.  The auction, led by Goldman Sachs and part of the company’s efforts to raise cash, kicked off last year and also drew interest from European private equity houses CVC Capital Partners and Permira.  In a statement on Monday, WPP said Kantar was valued at $4 billion including debt. Bain’s proposal was subject to negotiation and it was not certain the talks would result in a deal, the company said.  Shares of WPP closed up 2.2% at 1,012 pence on Monday after media reports reported earlier in the day that Bain emerged as the leading bidder.  Bain’s interest in Kantar is the latest private equity deal to emerge in recent weeks. Blackstone and Lego’s founding family on Friday took Merlin Entertainments (MERL.L) private in a $7.5 billion deal, in one of the biggest private equity deals in Europe in recent years.  Nestle (NESN.S) also said in May it was in exclusive talks to sell its skin health business to a consortium led by EQT Partners for 10.2 billion Swiss francs ($10.33 billion).  Kantar’s underlying sales fell 2% last year to 2.6 billion pounds with operating profit down 14% to 301 million pounds.  The business generates about 15% of WPP’s overall sales and provides brand and marketing communications research for some of the world’s largest advertisers.   It has traditionally weighed on WPP’s overall organic growth rates - a key measurement for the industry.  Analysts say Kantar risks losing market share to more tech-savvy peers, while its business model is challenged by consumer goods companies developing their own data teams, rather than relying on surveys undertaken by external firms.  First-quarter results in April showed the British company has been particularly hard hit in the United States, where a weak competitive performance in recent years has been compounded by the loss of work from Ford and others in 2018.  WPP, the owner of agencies including JWT and Ogilvy, is in the middle of an overhaul following several profit warnings in 2017 and 2018 and turmoil linked to founder Martin Sorrell’s abrupt departure over a complaint of misconduct, which he denied.  With technology transforming the way advertising is made, placed and sold, clients want WPP to better integrate its agencies so it can produce faster offerings across multiple platforms, at a cheaper cost.  WPP’s Mark Read, who took the helm of the 12-billion pound advertising giant last year, has pledged to spend 300 million pounds restructuring the group to bring it back in line with peers by the end of 2021.  Read, a soft-spoken executive who worked alongside Sorrell for decades, set out a plan in December to hire more creative staff, including around 1,000 new jobs to improve its senior leadership in its New York agencies, in a bid to return the company to growth.

Three decades ago, on June 15, 1987, the most beloved image file extension on the internet was birthed by a team of CompuServe developers seeking a way to compress images with minimal data loss. The solution: the GIF, a simple, flexible file format for lower-resolution pictures. My, how far we’ve come since those inauspicious beginnings. These days, the GIF is so ubiquitous as a piece of internet culture that it’s got its own offshoot formats like reaction GIFs, GIF art, and Tumblr GIF sets. The question of how to pronounce the word “GIF” has become a rote topic of cultural debate. (The man who invented the GIF, Steve Wilhite, says it with a soft ‘G,’ like Jif peanut butter, but most people on the internet say it with a hard ‘G,’ because a) it’s more fun, b) it avoids confusion with said brand of peanut butter, and c) come on, it’s Graphical Interchange Format, not Giraffe-ical Interchange Format.) On the surface, it might sound strange that a file format that has essentially remained unchanged since the ‘90s has managed to outlast so many other kinds of higher-level internet tech, from Flash animation to early JavaScript. But as the blog Enthusiasms notes, “the story of how [the GIF evolved] is really the story of the internet growing up.” It’s simultaneously a tale of how the internet’s design evolution impacted the GIF, and one of how the GIF impacted the internet’s design evolution. Ah, the ‘90s. The internet was awash in garish designs, thanks to websites with noisy wallpaper backgrounds, Comic Sans font, and the ubiquitous Website Under Construction sign. That Under Construction sign, along with many other cute, small animated icons, served as the average human’s introduction to the GIF. Netscape, Marc Andreessen’s early web browser, reigned supreme for a hot moment in late 1994 and early 1995, just before the advent of Internet Explorer (released along with Windows ‘95) and other competing browsers like Netscape’s eventual successor Firefox. The fate of the GIF was intertwined with Netscape’s early success. Netscape was the first browser to allow the user to interact with an image on a website instead of just text — meaning you could click on an image and have it link you to another webpage or new information. And when Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released in 1995, it supported the .GIF format, including animated GIFs. Thus, if you wanted an easy way to decorate your website, GIFs, whether static or animated, were simple and available. Plus, when compared to other file formats, these early GIFs took up very little space on your hard drive and required very little bandwidth to download. But even back in the ‘90s the GIF was already starting to transcend its workhorse origins. Early viral images like the Dancing Baby and meme-ish GIF-based websites like YTMND (You’re the Man Now, Dawg, a reference to a famous early meme) laid the groundwork for the later GIF-splosion. In fact, though the “Baby Cha-Cha,” as the boogying infant was known to 3-D modelers, began its life as a video in 1996, it wasn’t until developer John Woodell released it as a GIF later that year that its popularity began to spread. Another early meme was a literal whole page of GIFs — the famous “Hamster Dance” website, created by an art student named Deidre LaCarte in 1998. Early GIFs revealed two crucial things about the format: It was easy to pass around, and no matter how many frames it contained, it could be looped an infinite number of times, for an infinite supply of delight. As web design evolved during the early 2000s, the GIF largely fell out of favor except among meme fans, due to the popular conception that GIFs were tacky and garish. (At that point in the GIF’s history, popular conception wasn’t exactly wrong.) The emergence of Flash animation, JavaScript, and other more sophisticated tools for transmitting video and images online outstripped the GIF’s usefulness. Still, the GIF remained a useful way to transmit early memes and replicate Flash-based animation — like the 2001 Dancing Banana from the famous Flash animation Peanut Butter Jelly Time. Throughout the mid-2000s, the concept of “Web 2.0” was the reigning approach to web design. Flash was beginning to falter under the weight of its own clunky load time and the public’s dislike of splash pages — those time-consuming, graphics-heavy “front doors” to websites that would take forever to load and which didn’t always allow you to navigate freely on the corresponding website. Web 2.0 coincided with the advent of Google, Wikipedia, and the first social media platforms — MySpace, Facebook, and YouTube, which all debuted between 2003 and 2005. It emphasized less Flash-heavy design, better load times, and more elegant, prettier web pages. Smartphones, like the iPhone prototype that first appeared in 2005, were beginning to emerge, and their operating systems and early mobile browsers required more portable, lightweight web design and image handling, which would eventually shift the “Web 2.0” movement into an emphasis on responsive cross-platform design. By 2004, all of the existing patents on licensing for the GIF had expired, and the format essentially entered the public domain. The combination of fewer legal restrictions on the GIF and a broader, smartphone-boosted demand for a simple, quick, and more lightweight substitute for Flash animation brought the GIF back in a major way. GIF editing was becoming more advanced thanks to the growing accessibility of editing software like Photoshop, and people were beginning to convert video into GIF formats in order to quickly present video images. Meanwhile, the advent of YouTube in 2005 had begun to spur the confluence of meme culture with emerging vlogger culture and celebrity culture, and the GIF was there to capture it all. A classic example: 2007’s “Leave Britney Alone” meme, which gave us a famous proto-reaction GIF: These early video-to-GIF viral memes paved the way for the deluge of celebrity reaction GIFs in our future. And then came the onset of social media, and lo, GIFs were everywhere. Reddit, Twitter, and Tumblr launched in 2005, 2006, and 2007 respectively, and each of them played major roles in shifting the culture of social media toward the use of GIFs — especially the image-friendly Tumblr, where GIFs could be uploaded in sets of up to 10 images at once. On Tumblr, GIF sets were frequently elaborate, and people used them to tell stories or encapsulate and circulate current news. GIFs could also be easily embedded into the text of Tumblr posts or added to a “reblog” in order to react to an earlier poster’s thoughts. And on Reddit, entire subforums arose that were devoted to sharing the perfect reaction GIF or the perfect video moment in GIF form. Historically, the animated GIF could be a static image or series of static images looped continuously, looped only once, or looped as many or as few times as the user desired. While it’s always been true that GIFs could be looped infinitely or not looped at all, but the modern GIF is generally looped infinitely by default. The infinite loop has become a crucial part of its social function, and advances the GIF’s role in allowing viral videos to spread more easily across the internet in meme form. And today, it’s relatively easy for the average internet user to screengrab video or still images as GIFS and convert, edit, and add text and additional imagery to them. There are even services that automate the process, allowing GIFs to be more portable and versatile as they travel the web. Another crucial aspect of the modern GIF is its nature as a quick, all-purpose form of expression. “MFW/TFW” (“My Face/That Feeling When”) and “MRW” (“My Reaction When”) have become standard parts of internet lingo that precede the use of a reaction GIF. And while basically any GIF can be a reaction GIF, some GIFs have become so well known as reaction GIFs that they’ve essentially entered the cultural lexicon. Reaction GIFs are so broadly recognized as fundamental parts of expression on social media that modern social media platforms, from Twitter to Slack, now support GIF searches through third-party GIF platforms like Giphy and Gfycat. Meanwhile, innumerable smartphone apps support the sending of GIFs through texts. Finally, the modern era of GIFs has also seen the emergence of GIF artists — particularly on Tumblr, where people have made inroads in animated art while forming a complex and unique community. In 2013, Tumblr chose GIF artist and game designer Roger Von Biersborn as its first artist in residence, inviting him to create original art for the site. At the same time, more retro movements like the Glitch and Vaporwave art movements combine the GIF with the classic pixelation of the early internet to create a unique kind of magic. Similar to the GIF art on Tumblr is a form of GIF art called the “Cinemagraph,” a popular style of Instagram art begun by photographers Kevin Burg and Jamie Beck which attempts to create high-level GIF photography. In 1987, it’s highly unlikely that anyone imagined what a broad range and role the GIF would play in modern internet culture. But as the internet has evolved, the GIF has shown a surprising ability to evolve with it. It’s this durability, flexibility, and — let’s face it — just a touch of kitsch that has allowed the GIF to become the internet’s primary purveyor of memes and looping pictures. So where will the GIF take us from here? History would suggest that the future of the GIF will depend on how the internet itself evolves. Notably, Tumblr, Twitter, and Reddit, the current drivers of GIF culture, are all struggling to attain sustainability — and as we saw in the case of Vine, some kinds of internet art can’t outlive the death of a platform that birthed the culture surrounding them. But the GIF would seem to be here to stay. Technologically speaking, it’s portable and durable. Perhaps more importantly, it’s also expressive and fun. It has hopped from platform to platform for three decades without stopping, and remained popular in its highest and lowest resolutions, whether animated or cinematic, ironic or sincere. So GIF on, internet.

It’s been a long time since a person has entered the pantheon of all-time tough-as-hell motherfuckers.  Not since the days of Kimbo Slice fighting men in backyards to feed his family have we had a contender. That changes today as I would like to submit this weed clerk who fought off three robbers with a bong after taking a face full of bear spray into that canon of all-time toughies. Come with me as I lay out my case—yes it was all caught on video.  Actually, the video, which was posted online by a user named Big Daddy Dishrags, is almost just too perfect to be real. But a quick check of the Tyendinaga Police Service shows a Facebook Post describing what happened and asks for the public’s assistance in identifying the suspects. Police say that it all went down on September 6, at around 4 PM, at the Recreational Cannabis Farmers Market in Shannonville, around 200 kilometers [124 miles] northeast of Toronto.  Police say that three men entered the store and were met with “great resistance” by the “clerk who is from Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory.” Even though it’s an incredibly odd choice of words for some cops, “great resistance” is an accurate descriptor. So, without further ado, let’s take a look at what they mean. The video starts calmly with just the clerk and his co-worker walking around the store. The man walks behind the counter with the smallest dog you’ve ever seen in tow. Then, after about 50 seconds of nothing happening, the monotony is suddenly broken. Three men dressed in black hoodies with painter masks and rubber gloves rush into the building yelling “DOWN,” “GET THE FUCK DOWN,” and just straight up empty a goddamn can of bear mace. Now here is where shit gets wild. Does our hero, \"The Man with the Small Dog,\" allow his store to be robbed? No, fuck that, our man comes at them with a bong—a fucking BONG! Yup, as one of the men scoots around the side of the counter he is met with our hero, bong in hand, doing that weird hopping thing that you do before entering mortal combat. You know where you’re kind of just bouncing toward somebody because you’re ready for anything. He moves on the robbers brandishing the bong—it’s one of those larger (but not novelty large) glass bongs that your friend who is just a little TOO into weed owns—like you would a glass pipe. As he’s moving, the man with the pepper spray continues to spray it at him but it’s not working and the would-be robber who was trying to round the counter ski-fucking-daddles. At this moment, you can notice, the entire power hierarchy of this situation gets completely reversed. No longer are the men with the bear spray in charge, no, like a stoner John Wick, our hero behind the counter has fully taken the reins. Look at this guy.  For a solid six seconds, he has these would-be robbers just completely stumped and terrified. He’s brandishing the bong alternatively like a lead pipe and a baseball bat. He moves with a hand out just reaching for a hoodie to grab. He switches his focus from one to another to another and just completely has them stuck. They’re facing down a bong-wielding terminator who just walked through a cloud of bear spray and wasn’t fazed—I’d be frightened as well. Honestly, if the video just ended here it would be amazing but it’s what happens next which elevates it to an all-timer.  The would-be robbers know they’re not up against a simple clerk here and that their only hope to get out of this situation is weapons. So… looking around they grab the only thing available—a recycling bin.  The would-be robber brandishes this at the clerk and he just does not give two shits. The man shrugs his shoulders so nonchalantly, like it’s just another day in the office. You can almost read his thoughts in this moment and they’re a simple deep sigh and a “well... It’s a living.”  “What are you going to do with that?” asks the man defending his store (who just got bear sprayed and is currently facing down three robbers with a bong) incredulously.  Well, his opponent knew what he was going to do with it—the thing is though, it was not that great of a plan. The would-be robber hurls it at our man with all the gusto he has and actually sends it flying at a pretty good clip. However, our hero ducks it absolutely perfectly and allows it to just skim off his back. Now the bong-wielding clerk starts moving in on the would-be robbers—probably only because he’s getting bored of toying with them.  The man again shows his boredom with the situation by dropping his arms briefly before moving in for the kill. Bong held high, he charges and the men get the fuck out of there as quick as can be. As they flee, the clerk finally swings the bong, smashing it on something (someone?) and sending the bowl flying backward behind him. Then, just after they’re out of his hair, he takes a few moment to holler insults at the—remember, three—guys who tried to rob him. He slams the door shut behind them and then instructs his co-worker to call someone named Pete.  We don’t know who Pete is but, since they'll be assuredly making a movie out of this, I assume that he will play a big role in the sequel.
